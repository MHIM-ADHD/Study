### What is this advisory group about?
We would like you to advise on a research project investigating the daily life experiences of adolescents with a diagnosis of ADHD. Young people's views will be really important for this project.  Your role is to use your experience of ADHD to help us design a research study and interpret its findings through three individual discussions with a member of our research team. These discussions will take place at times that are convenient for you at the Department of Psychology at the University of Edinburgh. 

### Who can take part in the advisory group?
Young people **aged 12 to 14** with a **diagnosis of ADHD** can participate in this advisory group.

### Will I be compensated?
You will be compensated with **£30 per discussion** (**£90 total** for three sessions)! Local travel expenses will be covered and refreshments will be provided.  

### How can I take part in the advisory group?

This link [link to Qualtrics information page for young people] will take you to an information page which will give you all the information you need to before deciding whether you want to be a member of the advisory group. Before you can take part, you also need to get approval from one of your parents/caregivers. We have prepared an information page [link to Qualtrics information page & consent form for parents] for them as well. At the end of the parent information page, we ask your parents to fill in a short form, stating that they are happy for you to take part. Once they have completed the form, they will receive a link for you to sign up to participate in the study. You will also have to fill in a form to say that you agree to be a member of the advisory group and we will then get in touch with you to arrange a time to meet so you can share your views on the daily life experiences of adolescents with ADHD.
