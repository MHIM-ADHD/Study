However, current\r\n            interventions for emotion regulation and peer difficulties\r\n            have been criticized for focusing on deficits, not\r\n            reflecting real life contexts, nor focusing on adolescents.\r\n            They also don’t focus enough on the strengths that\r\n            adolescents with ADHD have. This research project,\r\n            undertaken by a team at the University of Edinburgh led by\r\n            Dr Aja Murray, uses online surveys and an ‘in-the-moment’\r\n            data gathering technique via a smartphone app to gain\r\n            insights into the daily life experiences of adolescents with\r\n            ADHD to help address this gap and pave the way for\r\n            developing appropriate interventions.\r\n            \r\n            For young people aged 12-14 with a diagnosis of ADHD and\r\n            their parents interested in participating in our research\r\n            study, which involves filling in some questionnaires and\r\n            completing very short surveys on a smartphone app, please\r\n            head to our study participant page for young\r\n            people or their parents.\r\n            As part of this research project, we are also recruiting\r\n            advisory group members, that is parents of young people aged\r\n            12-14 with a diagnosis of ADHD as well as young people aged\r\n            12-14 with a diagnosis of ADHD.

We are especially interested in how smartphones can be\r\n            used to support adolescents with ADHD in regulating their\r\n            emotions and enabling positive peer relationships.This will\r\n            helps us design our research study so that we can gain\r\n            opimal insights into how best to support adolescents with\r\n            ADHD and their families.
