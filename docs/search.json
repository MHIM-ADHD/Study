MHIM-ADHD is a\r\nresearch project exploring the daily life experiences of adolescents\r\nwith attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The project will\r\nexplore many aspects of daily life including peer relations, managing\r\nemotions and mental health. On this website, you can find information on\r\nthe study, and how you can take part , including links to information\r\nsheets, consent forms and online surveys. We will also update the\r\nwebsite with study\r\nfindings.\r\nSo why are we doing this\r\nproject?\r\nEvidence suggests that peer difficulties and emotion regulation\r\nchallenges contribute to co-occurring mental health issues for\r\nadolescents with ADHD. These might include anxiety, depression, and\r\nbehaviour problems. However, current interventions for emotion\r\nregulation and peer difficulties have been criticized for focusing on\r\ndeficits and neglecting strengths, not reflecting real life contexts,\r\nand not being suitably adapted for adolescents.. This project,\r\nundertaken by a team at the University of Edinburgh led by Aja Murray,\r\nuses online surveys and an ‘in-the-moment’ data gathering technique via\r\na smartphone app to gain insights into the daily life experiences of\r\nadolescents with ADHD. Findings from the study can help to inform better\r\ninterventions for adolescents with ADHD.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow can I take part?\r\nIf you are aged 12-14 with a diagnosis of ADHD you can take part in\r\nthis study with a parent. Taking part involves filling in some\r\nquestionnaires and completing very short surveys on a smartphone app.\r\nPlease head to our study participant page for\r\nyoung\r\npeople and\r\nparents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
