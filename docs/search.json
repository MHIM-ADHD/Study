However, current\r\n            interventions for emotion regulation and peer difficulties\r\n            have been criticized for focusing on deficits, not\r\n            reflecting real life contexts, nor focusing on adolescents.\r\n            They also don’t focus enough on the strengths that\r\n            adolescents with ADHD have. This research project,\r\n            undertaken by a team at the University of Edinburgh led by\r\n            Dr Aja Murray, uses online surveys and an ‘in-the-moment’\r\n            data gathering technique via a smartphone app to gain\r\n            insights into the daily life experiences of adolescents with\r\n            ADHD to help address this gap and pave the way for\r\n            developing appropriate interventions.\r\n            \r\n            For young people aged 12-14 with a diagnosis of ADHD and\r\n            their parents interested in participating in our research\r\n            study, which involves filling in some questionnaires and\r\n            completing very short surveys on a smartphone app, please\r\n            head to our study participant page for young\r\n            people or their parents.\r\n            As part of this research project, we are also recruiting\r\n            advisory group members, that is parents of young people aged\r\n            12-14 with a diagnosis of ADHD as well as young people aged\r\n            12-14 with a diagnosis of ADHD.

We are especially interested in how smartphones can be\r\n            used to support adolescents with ADHD in regulating their\r\n            emotions and enabling positive peer relationships.This will\r\n            helps us design our research study so that we can gain\r\n            opimal insights into how best to support adolescents with\r\n            ADHD and their families.

This form will be available at the end of the\r\n              linked information page. Once you have completed the form\r\n              you can start filling in the first questionnaire. At that\r\n              time, you will also receive a link to the young person\r\n              information page which also includes a form for your child\r\n              to fill in to let us know whether they would like to take\r\n              part in the study. After they have completed this form,\r\n              they can also fill in the first questionnaire and, once\r\n              they have done that, we will ask your child to download\r\n              the app to fill in the brief surveys for the next two\r\n              weeks.Once the two weeks are over, we will send both you\r\n              and your child another link that will take you to the\r\n              end-of-study questionnaire. Throughout the study, we will\r\n              be offering video calls to help with any questions you and\r\n              your child may have, for example relating to the\r\n              completion of consent forms or the setting up of the\r\n              smartphone app.\r\n               \r\n              \r\n              \r\n            \r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    ",
