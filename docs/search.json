The project will explore many\r\naspects of daily life including peer relations, managing emotions and\r\nmental health. On this website, we will proved some background\r\ninformation on the study, information on how you can participate in the\r\nstudy, including links to information sheets, consent forms and online\r\nsurveys. Upon completion of this research project, you will also find a\r\nsummary\r\nof our findings on this website.\r\nEvidence suggests that peer difficulties and emotion regulation\r\nchallenges contribute to co-occurring mental health issues for\r\nadolescents with ADHD, such as anxiety, depression, and behaviour\r\nproblems. However, current interventions for emotion regulation and peer\r\ndifficulties have been criticized for focusing on deficits, not\r\nreflecting real life contexts, nor focusing on adolescents. They also\r\ndon’t focus enough on the strengths that adolescents with ADHD have.\r\nThis research project, undertaken by a team at the University of\r\nEdinburgh led by Dr Aja Murray, uses online surveys and an\r\n‘in-the-moment’ data gathering technique via a smartphone app to gain\r\ninsights into the daily life experiences of adolescents with ADHD to\r\nhelp address this gap and pave the way for developing appropriate\r\ninterventions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor young people aged 12-14 with a diagnosis of ADHD and their\r\nparents interested in participating in our research study, which\r\ninvolves filling in some questionnaires and completing very short\r\nsurveys on a smartphone app, please head to our study participant page\r\nfor\r\nyoung\r\npeople or their\r\nparents\r\nAs part of this research project, we are also recruiting advisory\r\ngroup members, that is parents of young people aged 12-14 with a\r\ndiagnosis of ADHD as well as young people aged 12-14 with a diagnosis of\r\nADHD. As a member of the advisory group, we will ask you to help us\r\nunderstand which factors you think are most important for improving the\r\nlives of young people with ADHD and that researchers should look into\r\nmore. We are especially interested in how smartphones can be used to\r\nsupport adolescents with ADHD in regulating their emotions and enabling\r\npositive peer relationships.This will helps us design our research study\r\nso that we can gain opimal insights into how best to support adolescents\r\nwith ADHD and their families. For more information on the advisory\r\ngroups and on how to take part, see the information for the\r\nyoung\r\npeople advisory group or the information for the\r\nparent\r\nadvisory group.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
