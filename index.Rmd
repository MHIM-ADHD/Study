## About Me

My research focuses on the development of co-occurring mental health problems during childhood and adolescence. I'm also interested in quantitative methodology, particularly in relation to using longitudinal data analysis methods to enhance substantative reserach. 

Currently, I am working at the [Blakemore Lab](https://sites.google.com/site/blakemorelab/Home?authuser=0) to work on the [Cambridge Mind App (CaM-App) study](https://sites.google.com/site/blakemorelab/research/cambridge-mind-app-study?authuser=0) which investigates the mental health trajectories of adolescents and adults around the globe during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic using an innovative smartphone app. The CaM-App study collects data on mental health, as well as phone-based data such as app usage, movement and sleeping data to gain comprehensive insights into which behaviours might exacerbate or mitigate the negative effects of loneliness during social-distancing. 

Before joining the Universtiy of Cambridge, I completed my PhD in Psychology at the University of Edinburgh focusing on *Co-occurring Mental Health Problems across Childhood and Adolescence: Within-Person Developmental Relations, Mediators and Antecedents*.
